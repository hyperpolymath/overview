Development roadmap for the Overview hub-and-spoke mirroring infrastructure.

== Current State (v1.0)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |Status

|Hub-and-spoke mirroring
|✓ Complete — GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket

|Instant forge sync
|✓ Complete — Automatic propagation on push/release

|SSH host verification
|✓ Complete — MITM protection with ed25519 keys

|Supply chain security
|✓ Complete — SHA-pinned actions, minimal permissions

|Security documentation
|✓ Complete — SECURITY.md with procedures
|===

== Phase 1: Platform Expansion

=== Additional Forge Targets

* SourceHut (sr.ht)
* Gitea self-hosted instances
* Forgejo instances
* Radicle (peer-to-peer Git)

=== Protocol Support

* Native Git protocol where SSH unavailable
* HTTPS token authentication fallback
* GPG commit signing propagation

== Phase 2: Operational Hardening

=== Monitoring & Observability

* Sync status dashboard via GitHub Pages
* Failure notifications (email, webhook)
* Sync lag metrics and alerting
* Audit logging for compliance

=== Resilience

* Automatic retry with exponential backoff
* Partial failure handling (continue if one target fails)
* Self-healing on transient network issues
* Dead letter queue for failed syncs

== Phase 3: Advanced Distribution

=== Selective Mirroring

* Branch filtering (mirror only release branches)
* Tag pattern matching
* Repository allowlist/blocklist
* Per-repo target overrides

=== Release Automation

* Changelog generation across forges
* Release asset mirroring
* Platform-specific release notes
* Attestation propagation (SLSA, Sigstore)

== Phase 4: Federation & Decentralization

=== Multi-Hub Architecture

* Secondary hub failover
* Bidirectional sync (limited)
* Conflict detection and alerting

=== Decentralized Options

* IPFS/Filecoin archival
* Radicle integration for p2p distribution
* Self-sovereign identity for contributors

== Phase 5: Ecosystem Integration

=== Hyperpolymath Alignment

* STATE.scm metadata files
* META.scm project descriptors
* ECOSYSTEM.scm dependency graphs
* Guix/Nix reproducible builds

=== Tooling

* CLI for manual sync operations
* API for programmatic control
* Web dashboard for org-wide visibility

== Non-Goals

The following are explicitly out of scope:

* Two-way sync with conflict resolution
* Issue/PR mirroring (different per-forge semantics)
* Wiki mirroring
* CI/CD pipeline mirroring

== Contributing

Roadmap items are prioritized based on:

. Security impact
. Operational reliability
. User demand
. Implementation complexity
